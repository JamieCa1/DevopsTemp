# Documentation

Documentation is not stored in this repository, but using MS Loop. This includes:

- The architecture plan: an inventory of the infrastructure components needed to run the application, and how they interact.
    - This is a living document that should be updated throughout the project as the architecture evolves.
- Meeting minutes: keep track of all meetings with your supervisor and other stakeholders. Use the template below.
- Manuals for team members, e.g. how can a dev set up a local build server and test environment? How can an fellow ops reproduce the monitoring setup that you created?
- Reports, e.g. test plans and reports, security assessment reports, etc.
- Advisory report for the customer with recommendations and cost estimates for running the application in production.

The "templates" only indicate the expected *content*. You can choose the layout and format of the document, e.g. to make it consistent with other documentation kept by your team.

## Meeting minutes template

*Always* keep notes of any meeting that you have throughout the project. This includes meetings with your supervisor, but also meetings with other team members. 

Meetings with your superviser must be prepared in advance and the meeting minutes should be structured as indicated here. Replace "student1", "student2", etc. with the actual names of the team members.

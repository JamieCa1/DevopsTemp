## Repo contents

This repository should contain _all_ source code for setting up the infrastructure needed for the project. Documentation is not stored in this repository, see the study guide and [documentation.md](documentation.md) for more information.

Provide a table of contents of the repository _here_, with links to relevant directories. Maintain a clean directory structure and avoid code duplication!

To get started, you could reuse the [scaffolding code](https://github.com/HoGentTIN/infra-labs/tree/main/vmlab) for the [Configuration Management assignment](https://github.com/HoGentTIN/infra-labs/blob/main/assignment/2-cfgmgmt.md) of the Infrastructure Automation course.
